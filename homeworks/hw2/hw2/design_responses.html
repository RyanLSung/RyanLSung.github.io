							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article highlighted how the correct use of white space can bring visual clarity and balance to a layout. It has three main functions: maintaining focus, keeping the page organized, and improving the readability of the page. Although some may argue that white space is wasted space, the idea that less is more holds true. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was that it addressed counterarguments like "White space is wasted space!" I have heard both sides of too much versus too little white space before, so I enjoyed learning the author's rebuttals. Additionally, I like how the article addressed exactly what white space is useful for. Moving forward, I will keep the three functions in mind.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>

						</li>
