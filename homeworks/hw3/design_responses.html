							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Text is essential for designers as they are one of the primary ways designers can communicate with users. 
								A good design matches its typography with its purpose which helps set the mood, tone, and style.
								In the case that images are the focus of the design, simple fonts are best so that the images stand out.
								Finally, it is key to decide with the intented audience in mind as the users' age, interests, and cultural upbringing could influence the ideal type.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
