                Hey! My name is Ryand and I am from southern California. 
                I have a sister in high school named Natalie and a family Tuxedo cat named Mittens. 
                I played water polo during my 4 years in high school and I am currently on the club water polo team at UC Berkeley. 
                I like to skateboard, snowboard, ski, surf, and fish.
                Here are two truths and a lie about me:
                <ul>
                    <li>My favorite place to travel is Europe.</li>
                    <li>I studied abroad in Osaka, Japan this past summer for 9 weeks, and stayed with a host family who did not speak any English!</li>
                    <li>I can do a standing backflip.</li>
                </ul>
                My favorite places to eat at Berkeley are:
                <ul>
                    <li>IB's</li>
                    <li>Sizzling Lunch</li>
                    <li>Poke Parlor</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <div>
                <img src = "assets/img/cat.jpg"  alt="" id="logo">
                <img src = "assets/img/snowboard.jpeg" alt="" id="logo">
                <img src = "assets/img/fish.jpg" alt="" id="logo">
            </div>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Click here if you love cats!</a>

            <h2>Part 2: Reading Responses</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. After reading this article, I learned to assess apps by looking at 4 metrics: Hierarchy, Content, Intent, and Audience. The article highlighted the importance of words and how, as designers, we should consider the feelings that our design brings out. For instance, Airbnb giving a city instead of a generic "Search here" can excite the user about travleing.</li>
                    <li>2. My favorite part about the article was looking through multiple examples of everyday products that do design well. I learn best through examples, so I am glad they included some.</li>
                    <li>3. "Know the rules, so you can break em"</li>
                    <li>4. 8/10 - I would have liked it better if they had both a gif of the design and a photo of the end frame. It was hard to reference as I read.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
